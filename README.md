<span style="font-size:20px;"><b>All about me!</b></span>

Hello there! I am Justin Sienes, a current University of Illinois at Chicago student. I started getting into computer science during my freshman year of high school when one of my favorite teachers during my time there taught us to code in Java and I just enjoyed working behind the computer and learning. When it comes to computer science, especially when I first got exposed to code in my freshmen year of high school, I've been really curious about how I can develop cool things, especially products that are of better convenience. Today I am always willing to learn new things and see how to make cool products and problem-solve bugs that may arise as well.
